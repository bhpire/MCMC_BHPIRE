A M\+C\+MC algorithm to fit interferometric data with simple models.

The data are in a filename stored in variable \char`\"{}filename\mbox{[}$\,$\mbox{]}\char`\"{} in a simple A\+S\+C\+II format, defined and described in \hyperlink{readdata_8c}{readdata.\+c}

If the parameter V\+E\+R\+B\+O\+SE is set to 1, a log file will be created called \char`\"{}mcmc.\+log\char`\"{} with general information on the performance of the algorithm

The M\+C\+MC chains are recorded in a file with name stored in variable \char`\"{}chainfname\mbox{[}$\,$\mbox{]}\char`\"{}

The comparison of the model with the highest posterior to the data is recorded in a file with name stored in variable \char`\"{}modelfname\mbox{[}$\,$\mbox{]}\char`\"{}
